# Playwright Accelerator

A starter project for end-to-end testing using Playwright and TypeScript.

## TODO / Requirements

- The project should be modular, allowing installation of specific capabilities as needed.
- It must be usable as a standalone solution or as modular components within a microfrontend architecture.
- Documentation should clearly describe how to use the project in both standalone and modular/microfrontend scenarios.
- Provide examples for integrating with other modules or microfrontends.
- Each capability should be independently installable and configurable.
- Ensure compatibility with various environments and configurations.
- Include comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and configuration.
- Enable testing across various browsers and configurations, including integration with external services such as BrowserStack.
- Support for CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
- Ensure the project is maintainable and scalable for future enhancements.

## Manifesto

We believe in empowering teams to deliver high-quality web applications with speed, confidence, and flexibility. This project is built on the following principles:

- **Rapid Ramp-Up**: Make it easy for teams to get started quickly by offering a well-organized structure, practical defaults, and thorough documentation.
- **Standardisation**: Promote best practices and consistency across teams and projects through shared tooling, conventions, and automation.
- **Modularity**: Every capability should be independently installable and configurable, enabling teams to compose their ideal toolchain.
- **Developer Experience**: Tools and workflows should be intuitive, fast, and supportive of best practices out of the box.
- **Scalability**: Solutions must work for both small projects and large, distributed systems, including microfrontend architectures.
- **Quality Gates**: Automated testing, linting, and formatting are essential to maintain code quality and reliability at every stage.

Join us in building a flexible, modern, and robust foundation for web application testing and development.
